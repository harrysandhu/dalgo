- greedy algorithm
    - repeatdly makes locally best choice/decision ignoring future

- tree: connected acyclic graph

- spanning tree: contains all the verticies 
    - FIND OF A GRAPH G
    - tree from the graph
    - subset of graph

     


- MST:
    - given graph and edge weights w : E- >R
    - find a spanning tree T of minimum weight = sum(w(e))
